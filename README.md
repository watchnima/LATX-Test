LATX test suite
================

**LATX** is LoongArch translator - X86, which developed by Loongson Lab.

**LATX test suite** is a test project aimed to test LATX. I try to include three parts in this suite:

1. Unit tests. Test the translate process in the unit of a single instruction. Verify instructions' function.
2. TB tests. Test the translate process among TBs.
3. Test database. The database records the cases that cause bugs during the developing process.
